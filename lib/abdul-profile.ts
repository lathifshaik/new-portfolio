        content: "Sometimes I feel like I'm just borrowing this body —\nmoving through the world, doing, feeling, creating —\nbut somewhere behind my eyes, there's a gap.\nA space where I'm just… watching. Aware that one day,\nthis body won't move again.\nThat there'll be no more me to feel the wind,\nto hold someone close, to laugh or ache or dream.\n\nI didn't exist once. And one day, I won't again.\nEverything I am — my thoughts, my voice, my hopes —\nthey'll vanish like they never were.\nAnd the people I love will fade too,\ninto that same soft silence.\n\nBut right now… I'm here.\nAnd you're here.\nAnd somehow, that feels like enough.\nLike in this brief flicker of time,\nyou make existing feel a little more infinite"

        translation: "Never would I have thought that nobody has ever met loneliness,\nThis is the story of when I first encountered the highest loneliness of my life\n\nWhy they were so important to me, I only understood after going through that affection,\nSometimes she would angrily say, 'If you don't listen to me, I'll never talk to you again' (her anger would become a means for an unknown smile...)\nShe was such a friend that even if you tried to find passion in her, your life would fall short. I didn't even realize how strange time is\n\nTime itself becomes the means for a new meeting and then snatches that meeting away itself.\n\nEven today, her memories surely bring a smile to my face, but the heart doesn't have the courage to support it\nSo many tears fell in her memories; if you don't believe it, ask that pillow\n\nIt's evident that I will never see her again in life,\nNow all I have left are her memories, which will remain safe in this heart that still flows with her remembrance."

She deserved far better than what I could offer, yet all I ever wanted was to see her face light up with happiness. Alas, she had found someone better, and I chose to take my leave. Nonetheless, I can't help but ponder whether she's truly happy, and though I wish her the best, her absence leaves a void that lingers. I yearn for the days of our initial calls and the comfort of her presence. Farewell forever, for I must endeavor to banish these memories and move on."
